# **PROJECT TITLE :IoT based alert system for Accident prone areas in national highway**
Most number of accidents in the Indian National Highway occurs in the T and Y-junctions through which the small cities/villages are connected to the highway. There the vehicle coming from the joint roads while crossing accross the road, they crash with vehicles coming in highway and causing merciless deaths. <br>
    To reduce the count of accidents in those highway roads we are currently making an alerting system using IoT components by using the fund provided by our college. We IoT components such as **Raspberry pi, Arduino UNO, Radar speed detection sensor and Raspberry pi camera module(for number plate capturing)**. Our IoT model detects the speeds of approaching vehicles before 200metres before the junction & if the speed of approaching vehicle is higher the specified speed limit then we would alert the vehicles from the joint roads not to cross now or singals like when to cross.<br><br>
    Initialy we made a simple prototype that would produca an alert through buzzer, Led and digital monitor when motion is detected simply. components used are raspberry pi, Ultrasonic sensor.

    recently, we made another prototype which is better than previous one. It would detect speed of object which is approaching the sensor and provies alert through buzzer and Led's. Components used are Arduino UNO, Ultrasonic sensor.
